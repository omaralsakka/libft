## :pencil: Project's goal:

This project is all about re-creating from scratch basic **C language functions**, which was a great way to understand a lot
of different data types, memory and memory allocating and more.

## :heavy_plus_sign: Installation:

1-  ```git clone git@github.com:omaralsakka/libft.git```

2-  ```make```

3-  **optional**: ```make clean```

## :open_book: User guide:

As mentioned earlier, most of those functions do exist in c, hence if you are not familiar with the way of using one of them
search in terminal ```man <function name>``` without ```ft_``` from the beginning of the function's name.

## :warning: Note:

Not all functions are re-created with the exact original name, so make sure to check **libft.en.pdf** for more info.

## :broom: Cleaning:

```make fclean```
